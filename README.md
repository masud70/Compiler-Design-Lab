# Compiler Design Lab

## Overview

Welcome to the Compiler Design Lab repository! This repository contains the source code and documentation for a comprehensive exploration of compiler design concepts. From Lexical Analysis to Three Address Code we've got you covered.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: Implementation of lexical analysis to tokenize source code.
- **Syntax Analysis**: Building parsers to validate the syntax of programming languages.
- **Three-Address Code**: Generation of intermediate code for efficient code representation.
- **ANTLR4**: Utilization of ANTLR4 parser generator for parsing tasks.
- **BISON**: Integration of BISON parser generator for syntax analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **[ANTLR4](https://www.antlr.org/)**: ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator. To install it, follow these steps:

  - **Linux/Unix**:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install antlr4
    ```

  - **macOS**:

    ```bash
    brew install antlr
    ```

  - **Windows**:

    You can download the ANTLR4 JAR files from the official ANTLR website (https://www.antlr.org/download.html).

- **[BISON](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)**: Bison is a parser generator that is essential for syntax analysis. To install it, follow these steps:

  - **Linux/Unix**:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install bison
    ```

  - **macOS**:

    ```bash
    brew install bison
    ```

  - **Windows**:

    You can download Bison for Windows from the GNU website (https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/).


### Installation

1. Clone the Repository:
    ```
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/Compiler-Design-Lab.git
    ```

2. Explore the Code: Dive into the source code to understand the implementations and algorithms used for each compiler component.

3. Build and Run: Follow the provided instructions in each subdirectory to build and run different parts of the compiler.
