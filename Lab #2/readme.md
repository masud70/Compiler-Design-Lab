# Compiler Design Lab - Lab 2

## Simple Parser Analysis

In Lab 2, the task was to investigate the "Simple Parser" and provide a detailed analysis report based on the investigation. The Simple Parser is a foundational component in compiler design, responsible for syntactic analysis.

## Files

- `SP.pdf`: A report detailing the analysis of the Simple Parser.

## Instructions

1. **Investigation**: Study the Simple Parser (SP) from the internet. Understand the logic, structure, and functionality of the Simple Parser. Identify key components and how they contribute to the parsing process.

2. **Analysis Report**: Write a comprehensive analysis report (`SP.pdf`) covering the following aspects:
   - Overview of the Simple Parser: Explain the purpose and role of the Simple Parser in the context of compiler design.
   - Parsing Algorithm: Describe the parsing algorithm used in the Simple Parser.
   - Limitations: Identify any limitations or potential issues with the Simple Parser.
   - Suggestions: Suggest if it should be used in our lab course considering it's uses in current days.

## Analysis Report Format

The analysis report (`SP.pdf`) should be written in pdf format, providing clear sections for each aspect of the analysis.

## Submission

Submit your analysis report on the provided deadline.

## Notes

- Make sure to focus on the critical aspects of the Simple Parser in your analysis.
- Provide code snippets or excerpts where necessary to support your analysis.

Happy analyzing!
